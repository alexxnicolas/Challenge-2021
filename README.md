# Challenge-2021

The goal of this challenge is to learn how to use Python and its packages, and to have our first step as a data scientist.

On the one hand, we have to predict the number of bicycle passing in Albert 1st between 00:01 AM and 09:00 AM on Friday, April 2nd, using the data from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQVtdpXMHB4g9h75a0jw8CsrqSuQmP5eMIB2adpKR5hkRggwMwzFy5kB-AIThodhVHNLxlZYm8fuoWj/pub?gid=2105854808&single=true&output=csv. 

On the other hand, we have to visualize the bike traffic in Montpellier with the data from http://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-eco-compteurs/resource/75f5e367-99fb-482f-ba5c. For this part, we give one HTML file per day where you can see intensity of bike traffic at some places in Montpellier. The radius is proportional to the intensity : the bigger the radius is, the bigger the number of bikes is. We also make a GIF which shows the evolution of bike traffic per day, i.e each frame corresponds to a day.
